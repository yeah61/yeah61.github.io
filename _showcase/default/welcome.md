    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Welcome to my showcase, where I share more about my life, work, and projects. I pursue research in security, find resilience in sports, joy in traveling, and passion in teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond work, I find strength and resilience in sports, which fuel my determination and keep me fit to keep exploring science for decades to come.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also enjoy traveling—believing in both ‘reading thousands of books’ and ‘walking thousands of miles’—as a way to refresh my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        Teaching is another passion of mine, as guiding students is also a process of deepening and clarifying my own knowledge.
