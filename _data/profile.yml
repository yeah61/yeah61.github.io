  <p>
    I am a final-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Kansas, advised by <a href="https://ittc.ku.edu/~fli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Fengjun Li</a> and <a href="https://www.ittc.ku.edu/~bluo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Bo Luo</a>. 
    My research has been a continuous journey to understand how security connects sensing, communication, and artificial intelligence across the digital and physical worlds.
    My research interests include:
    <br style="line-height: 0.6;">
    <br>• Trustworthy and privacy-preserving ML/AI: Adversarial ML; Prompt injection; AI misinformation and misuse.
    <br>• CPS/Mobile security and privacy: Covert and side channels; Sensor-driven adversarial perception; Privacy protection.
    <br>• Communication security: NFC; Optical fiber communication; UAV navigation and control-link.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before joining KU, I received my B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Beihang University. 
    After graduation, I worked as a full-time research scientist at the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
