  <p>
    With a strong academic background in both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 
    I bring a unique perspective to security research at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds. 
    Specifically, advanced sensor spoofing attacks and defenses in modern machine-learning back-end systems and user-centric scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    - Human-imperceptible and out-of-band signal spoofing, where subtle sensor manipulations can bypass robust machine-learning models.
    
    - Legitimate user-interactionâ€“driven spoofing, exploiting natural signals generated through ordinary user behavior to evade detection.
    
    - Integrated side-channel and covert-channel strategies, enabling non-intrusive defenses as well as stealthier, end-to-end attack chains.
