abstract: >-
    In this paper, We present SensorBomb, a logic-bomb framework that violates this assumption by auto-contextualizing triggers within an app’s legitimate sensor usage, actuator behaviors, and functional context, using onboard sensor–actuator covert channels and dynamically adapted trigger patterns to evade analysis, fuzzing, anomaly detection, and user suspicion.
