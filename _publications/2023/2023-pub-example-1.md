  Ethics is an important criterion for security research. This work presents the current status and trends that security researchers have taken to address ethical concerns in their studies from a data perspective. In particular, we created a dataset of 3,756 papers published in three top-tier conferences between 2010 and 2022, among which 963 papers were identified with ethical concerns. With this dataset, we provided answers to three questions regarding the current practices and trends: (1) What is the landscape of ethical considerations in security research? For example, how many security research projects have raised ethical concerns in their studies, and which research areas are likely to cause ethical risks and concerns? (2) What are the current practices to address these ethical risks? And (3) What are the important factors impacting the ethical awareness of researchers?
